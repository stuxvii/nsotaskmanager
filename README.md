## KNOWN BUGS
* you cant open it directly

no fucking clue what causes this, but if you're autostarting it and if you are just doing ``love /path/to/nso.love`` then you shouldn't be worrying
* lag

im too lazy to do separate threads to handle getting the info (pull requests welcome)

## build from source
uhhhhhhhhhh clone everything and umm compile the cppsource files into a folder called bin blobs with their respectives disk, mem, and cpu names
then run love . in the same directory of that and yeah
