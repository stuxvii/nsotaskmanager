## HOW TO RUN
clone the repo
run ``love .`` in a terminal inside the cloned folder
it SHOULD work as long as your working directory is indeed the cloned folder
im sorry that it's like this it's just an amateur love (no pun intended) project
## KNOWN BUGS
* lag

im too lazy to do separate threads to handle getting the info (pull requests welcome)

## build from source
uhhhhhhhhhh clone everything and umm compile the cppsource files into a folder called bin blobs with their respectives disk, mem, and cpu names
then run love . in the same directory of that and yeah
